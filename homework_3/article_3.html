        This video details the events leading up to the discovery of the
        periodic system. <br />
        Visit: elementsunearthed.com to find out more. In this first half of<br />
        Part 1, Dr. Eric Scerri of UCLA, an expert on the history of the<br />
        periodic table, is interviewed and discusses why the periodic table
        is<br />
        the central organizing chart of chemistry and how chemists in the
        early<br />
        19th Century began to organize elements in tables based on atomic<br />
        weights and properties using the idea of triads. He also discusses<br />
        Prout's Law and the events leading up to the Karlsruhe Conference in<br />
        1860, a watershed event which led directly to the development of the<br />
        periodic system.<br />
